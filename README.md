Hi, I'm @joelflake and you can find me online at [JoelFlake.net](https://www.joelflake.net).

- I'm a server-side software engineer in Seattle, WA with deep PHP experience in varied professional and corporate environments.
- I have a smattering of experience in front-end development with jQuery.
- At my last job, I ended up doing a front-end project requiring back-end support in a Java / SpringBoot application and had a ton of fun.
- Accordingly, I'm actively re-learning Java as well as properly learning Javascript for the first time in both server-side and browser environments.
- I'm also actively teaching myself modern DevOps technology.
